#RBP means any of the RIP-seq fasta files

##Bowtie-build

# Genome was is 17 parts, each part was stated and seperated by a "," no spaced.
bowtie-build -C -f ~/EF4.genome.parts > ~/EF4.
# this created 5 reference genome 
# -C makes references in colourspace
# -f reads for fasta files as input

## Bowtie-inspect

# inpsects the 6 reference files are in colourspace
bowtie-inspect EF4.

## Bowtie

# run read alignments 
bowtie -C -a -m 1 -n 3 -y e 70 l 28 ~/EF4. ~/RBP.fasta -S RBP.sam
# -C sees in colourspace
# -a reports at the end of the code
# -m 1 only reads with 1 or fewer reportable alignments are reported
# -n 3 allows for at least 3 mismatches in the seed
# -y bowtie will backtrack many times to get as many counts as possible
# -e 70 maximum quality blues at all mismatched reads in entire alignments
# -l 28 size of "seed" of a read alignment
# -S makes sam.files

##samtools view

# sam.files were converted to more manaeagable formats
samtools view -bS -o ~/RBP.bam ~/RBP.sam
# -bS reads sam.file and make bam.file
# -o output to file

##samtools sort

~/RBP.bam, ~/RBP.sorted

##indexing

#keeps a log of samtools output
samtools index RBP.sorted.bam
samtools idxstats RBP.sorted.bam

##htseq

#make read counts
htseq-count --format=bam --order=pos --quiet --stranded=yes ~/RBP.sorted.bam ~/transcript.gtf > ~/RBP.count.txt
# --format=bam input is bam
# --order=pos how the input data is sorted
# --quiet supress progress reports and warnings
# --stranded=yes data is strand specific
